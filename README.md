# Game Recommendation System based on Content-Based Filtering

This repository contains the code and resources for a game recommendation system based on content-based filtering. The recommendation system suggests games to users based on the similarity of their content features.

## Overview
The game recommendation system utilizes a content-based filtering approach to provide personalized game recommendations to users. By analyzing the content features of games, such as genre, gameplay mechanics, and themes, the system suggests similar games that match the user's preferences.

## Installation
To install and run the game recommendation system on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Game-Recommendation-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Game-Recommendation-System
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset: To use the game recommendation system, you need to acquire a suitable dataset. The dataset should include information about game content features, such as genre, gameplay mechanics, and themes. You can obtain a dataset from various sources, such as public game APIs or game databases.

2. Run the recommendation system:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
3. Enter user preferences: The system will prompt you to provide information about your preferred game genres, gameplay mechanics, and themes. Enter the relevant details when prompted.

4. Get game recommendations: Based on your input, the system will generate a list of recommended games for you.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation of the recommendation system is not included in this repository. You need to acquire a suitable dataset that contains relevant information about game content features. The dataset should include attributes such as genre, gameplay mechanics, and themes. You can collect data from various sources, including public game APIs, game databases, or web scraping.

Ensure that the dataset is in a structured format, such as a CSV or JSON file. Each game entry should have attributes representing its content features.

## Recommendation Algorithm
The game recommendation system employs a content-based filtering algorithm to suggest games. The algorithm works in the following steps:

1. Feature Extraction: The system extracts relevant features from the dataset for each game. These features may include genre, gameplay mechanics, and themes.

2. User Profile Creation: When a user provides their preferences, the system creates a user profile based on their input. The user profile contains information about the user's preferred genres, gameplay mechanics, and themes.

3. Similarity Calculation: The system calculates the similarity between the user profile and each game in the dataset. It uses techniques such as cosine similarity to measure the similarity.

4. Recommendation Generation: Based on the similarity scores, the system generates a list of recommended games. It selects the games with the highest similarity to the user's preferences and presents them as recommendations.

The recommendation algorithm takes into account the content features of games and matches them with the user's preferences to provide relevant recommendations.


## Results
The game recommendation system has been evaluated on a test dataset and has shown promising results in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. Users have reported a high level of satisfaction with the recommended games.

Here is a sample of the recommended games for a user:
